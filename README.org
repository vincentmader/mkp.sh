** `mkp` CLI tool

This repo contains a small script I wrote to facilitate the creation of projects with org-mode in my Doom Emacs setup.

A usage example is given here:
#+begin_src
mkp "Demonstrate mkp usage."
#+end_src

On execution, the following things will then be created:
- A project directory `~/org/0_inbox/demonstrate_mkp_usage`.
- A project org-file `~/org/0_inbox/demonstrate_mkp_usage/Demonstrate mkp usage.org`.
- A project headline (with links to the above) in `~/org/Index.org`.

TODOs for the future:
- I probably will have to spend some time on appropriately handling special characters (e.g. backticks & apostrophes) in the project name.
